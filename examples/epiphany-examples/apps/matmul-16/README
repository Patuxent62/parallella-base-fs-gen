MATMUL multicore big matrix multiplication for Parallella-16 computer
=====================================================================

YS, Jul.2013


This project demonstrates the application of a multicore host-accelerator device for performing
the parallel big matrix multiplication.

This project contains the following components:

   host/        - where the host related files are stored and processesd
        src/    - the source files
        Release - makefiles and scripts for creating an optimized version of the program
        Debug   - makefiles and scripts for creating a debug version of the program

   device/      - where the host related files are stored and processesd
        src/    - the source files
        Release - makefiles and scripts for creating an optimized version of the program
        Debug   - makefiles and scripts for creating a debug version of the program

   build.sh     - shell script for building the project
   run.sh       - shell script for running the project
