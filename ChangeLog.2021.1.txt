Parallella image changes

Changelog for patuxent-parallella 2021.01 (beta)
-The starting point for this build is the 2019.1 beta build by Ola Jeppsson

-This build is based on the standard Ubuntu Bionic Beaver 18.04.5 core fs, not linaro

-All image resource files were updated to include the patuxent-parallella modified
 versions of the files (Ephiphany-SDK, ADI Kernel, devicetree.dtb, parallella.bit.bin)

-The updated resource files fix issues with HDMI support and sound support in the
 2019.01 beta version

-The updated resource files split EMIO GPIO pin control between ARM processors and the
 epiphany cores. GPIO Pins GN0,GP0 to GN8, GP8 can now be controlled from epiphany, GPIO Pins
 GN9, GP9 to GN11, GP11 can still be controlled from the ARM processors.

-Currently, this build only supports the standard desktop version of the parallella
 (Xilinx Zynq 7010 with HDMI support)

-The script and framework for the overall automation of the build was removed. This
 version uses a manual build sequence described in README.manual.md

-This build sequence is modified to use qemu and schroot to fully cross-build the root
 filesystem with no requirement to perform any build steps on actual parallella hardware

-The list of base packages installed has been pruned and updated to reduce apt warnings during the
 build. If only the base packages are installed, a full-function headless image can be realized.

-To provide X support, a second list of desktop packages are installed.

-Both lists of packages are now installed using a script from chroot instead of a complex command

-Support for Brown Deer COPRTHR remains broken and has been removed from this image build

-The e-gdb tool was discovered as broken in the 2019.1 version and currently remains broken
 in this image build. This may change in the future.
